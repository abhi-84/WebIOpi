# WebIOpi
Control home appliances from Webpage using IoT

In this project, I have used WebIOpi service and weaved service (now remote.it service) to access my devices connected to Raspberry pi from any network (local or global) 
via a Webpage. On my Webpage, I have used javascript to create button and slider to turn ON or OFF my LED and used slider to 
change the direction of my servo motor.
These devices can be replaced by real home appliances using relays (if required).
